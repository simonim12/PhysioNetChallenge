1. Use ptbxl_output to read data and create run feature extraction        (Create_one_beat_file.ps1)
Create_one_beat_file.ps1 will use make_one_beat.py run through all folders of ptbxl_output and extract features from all folders
use samitrop_output to extract features
run make_one_beat file 
Copy all .hea and .csv to the data folder
train model on .csv

#data travels in the following path in this project
# raw data => ptbxl_output=>Data Processing => data (.hea and .csv)
# raw data => samitrop_output=>Data Processing => data (.hea and .csv)
